The Dinosaur Pictures Facebook app, aka dinobot, is a Facebook Messenger bot
that provides information on dinosaurs.

It records conversations in order to train better responses.  Also, your
conversations are viewable by any admins of the Facebook page.  Because this is
an open source project, your conversations may also be made publicly available
as part of a training or example corpus.  You shouldn't expect that your
conversations with dinobot are private.
